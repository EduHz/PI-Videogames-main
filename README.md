## Videogames - Individual Proyect

This individual project is part of the final stage of my studies at the Henry Academy.
In my case, the project I had to carry out was a video game website.
On this page you can filter the video games, create new video games, and see the details of each one of them.
The technologies that I use for this project are:
- Javascript
- React
- React-Redux
- React-Router
- Postgresql
- Express
- Sequlize
- Morgan
- CSS(without frameworks)

------------


In the home page, you have the cards with a genres and rating of games

Download the repository and then run in the terminal `npm install`, for the dependencies, and `npm start`, to view the page locally,

Enjoy it! :fa-star:
