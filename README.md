## Videogames - Individual Proyect

This project is part of the final stage of my studies at the Henry Academy. In my case, the project I had to carry out was a video game website. On this page you can filter the video games, create new video games, and see the details of each one of them

Here I use all the technologies learned:

-Javascript
-React
-React-Redux
-React-Router
-Postgresql
-Express
-Sequalize
-Morgan

Download the repository and then run in the terminal `npm install`, for the dependencies, and `npm start`, to view the page locally,

Enjoy it!
